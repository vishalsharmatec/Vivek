Q-What data security measures do you have?
Ans-As a responsible global community, Opinion Edge deploys a spectrum of measures to protect panel and survey data from all conceivable risks and threats. All members' private information is encrypted and protected by an electronic key. To prevent unauthorized access, our website leverages robust Encryption Communication Technologies, including SSL (Secure Sockets Layer Protocol), which is a system that encrypts data to ensure the security of private info on our website.

Q-How is my signup information stored and used?
Ans-The profile data of all our members is stored on a highly secure server that allows only Opinion Edge to contact the ones whose specific criteria match any given survey. The query generation process is completely automated. The information provided by members is never sold, nor used for any other purposes besides identifying suitable surveys, contacting the members for participation, and processing rewards. No member of the Opinion Edge community is obligated to buy or pay for any product or service at any time, nor have we sanctioned any company to solicit our members as a result of joining our panel.

Q-Why should I share my personal info such as age, income, etc.?
Ans-We need your personal information to match suitable surveys aligned with your interests and expertise. For instance, in some cases, a client may require feedback from individuals from a certain age group, whose income falls in a certain range. In such cases, we use our membersâ€™ personal information to identify eligible participants. That said, please be assured that all personal information is securely stored and used exclusively for the purposes of survey mapping and reward processing.
